# Sintef-PushMe
This application is build as an open source physical activity support platform .There are many physical activity motivation applications and platforms, such as Runtastic, Moves, Accupedo, etc. 
 
Those applications have implemented some behavior changing techniques (such as goal setting, review of outcomes, social support, etc). However they do not relate them much with behavior change theory, in the sense that neither the user nor someone that would use those platforms for a physical activity stimulus intervention, can get much insight the behavior acceptance stage the user is in or which theories impact best etc.
 
The group has implemented the behavior change techniques(BCTs) based on BCS theory and has the possibilty of mobile application ingtegration.

Please refer to the Wiki for the detailed document of the project.
